# AICTE-Drishti — Project Overview
**AICTE Application Intelligence & Regulatory Verification Platform**  
*Smart India Hackathon 2026 | Problem Statement 26261*

---

## 1. Executive Summary & Problem Statement

Each academic year, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) processes tens of thousands of institutional applications for:
- Establishment of New Technical Institutions.
- Extension of Approval (EoA) for existing institutions.
- Increase in Sanctioned Intake or Addition of New Courses/Divisions.
- Introduction of Supernumerary Quotas (e.g., FN, OCI, NRI, EWS, TFW).
- Change in Site, Location, or Management.
- Closure of Programmes, Courses, or Institutions.

### 1.1 Current Scrutiny Challenges
1. **High Document Volume & Cognitive Load**: A single application comprises dozens of multi-page legal affidavits, land ownership deeds, master building plans, university affiliation letters, state government NOCs, fire and life safety certificates, audited financial balance sheets, and detailed faculty rosters.
2. **Manual Cross-Referencing Bottlenecks**: Scrutiny committees must manually cross-check self-reported portal declarations against uploaded documentary proof, historical Extension of Approval (EoA) data, and regulatory limits defined in the AICTE Approval Process Handbook (APH).
3. **Inconsistent Scrutiny & Undetected Discrepancies**: Subtle inconsistencies—such as mismatched land survey numbers, expired NOC validity periods, faculty members simultaneously listed across multiple institutions, or sanctioned intake exceeding built-up instructional space—can be easily missed during manual review.
4. **Lack of Explainable Audit Trails**: When applications are marked deficient, institutions frequently seek clarification on the exact regulatory clause or document defect that triggered the query, leading to prolonged appeals and delays.

### 1.2 The AICTE-Drishti Solution
**AICTE-Drishti** is an AI-assisted regulatory compliance, document authentication, and preliminary scrutiny platform tailored to the AICTE approval lifecycle. It ingests institutional applications and supporting documents, parses digital and scanned files via multi-modal extraction, performs deterministic cross-document and institutional record reconciliation, executes versioned AICTE Approval Process Handbook (APH) compliance checks, and generates evidence-linked findings for authorized scrutiny officers.

AICTE-Drishti is built upon a fundamental architectural principle:
> **"The system flags and explains. The AICTE officer decides."**  
> AICTE-Drishti automates cognitive drudgery and surfaces evidence-linked anomalies; it never makes automated adverse regulatory decisions.

## 2. Regulatory Grounding & Verification Status

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Regulatory Source Verification Notice**:  
> No local AICTE Approval Process Handbook (APH) PDF is currently present in the project workspace repository.  
> Therefore, in strict adherence to regulatory integrity:
> 1. All proposed rules in this specification are grounded in public AICTE Approval Process Handbook guidelines (2024–2027 norms), but are explicitly designated as:  
>    `[PLACEHOLDER PENDING OFFICIAL HANDBOOK MAPPING]`.
> 2. Specific rule codes, clauses, and handbook page numbers will be formally bound and verified once the official APH PDF document is provided.
> 3. AICTE-Drishti does not invent regulatory requirements or claim official AICTE authorization. Rules are structured as versioned YAML data files that can be updated without altering application code.

## 3. Core Objectives

1. **Automate Preliminary Scrutiny**: Reduce manual review cycle times by automatically verifying mandatory checklists, document completeness, and validity dates upon submission.
2. **Evidence-Linked Findings**: Provide human reviewers with contextualized findings linking every flagged discrepancy directly to the source document, page, observed value, expected value, and the applicable regulatory clause.
3. **Cross-Document & Record Reconciliation**: Compare declarations made in application forms against historical institutional records (past approvals, approved intake) and across multi-source uploaded documents (e.g., land deed vs. building approval vs. declared campus area).
4. **Anomaly & Authenticity Screening**: Detect identical duplicate documents using cryptographic hashing (SHA-256), inspect PDF metadata and incremental updates, compute perceptual hashes (pHash) to detect reused infrastructure photographs, decode embedded QR codes with mock authority lookups, and perform fuzzy institution-name matching.
5. **Full Lifecycle Deficiency Rectification**: Support formal requests for additional information, seamless replacement document ingestion, targeted re-validation of affected rules without invalidating untouched findings, and complete hash-chained audit tracking.
6. **Simulated Integration Boundaries**: Establish clean, modular adapter contracts for future integration with national services (DigiLocker, State University Affiliation Portals, National Academic Depository) while operating reliably with transparently labeled synthetic demonstration data for the SIH 2026 prototype.

```

### Module 1: Application Intake & OpenAPI Gateway
- Implements an OpenAPI-documented REST endpoint (`POST /api/v1/applications`) with strict Pydantic schemas.
- Validates file constraints (MIME type verification: PDF, PNG, JPEG; size ceiling 25 MB).
- Computes cryptographic SHA-256 digests immediately upon upload.
- Dynamically selects versioned YAML compliance checklists based on application category.

### Module 2: Institutional Record Retrieval & Adapter Layer
- Retrieves ground-truth institutional baseline data (previous approvals, approved intake, registered campus coordinates, accredited programmes).
- Uses a decoupled Repository/Adapter pattern: includes a synthetic record adapter for the prototype and defines strict interface contracts for future official AICTE portal hooks.
- All simulated records display clear `[SIMULATED]` badges.

### Module 3: Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) & OCR
- **Digital Extraction**: Fast native extraction using PyMuPDF (`fitz`) for vector/digital PDFs to extract text layers, embedded fonts, and coordinate bounding boxes.
- **OCR Subsystem**: Scanned page processing using Tesseract OCR with OpenCV image pre-processing (grayscale, Otsu thresholding, deskewing). If Tesseract binary is not installed, falls back gracefully to PyMuPDF with structured heuristic extraction.
- **Document Categorization**: Classifies uploaded files against expected document categories.
- **Structured Field Extraction**: Heuristic and regex extractors targeting key fields: Certificate Numbers, Issue Dates, Expiry Dates, Issuing Authorities, Survey Numbers, Land Area, Sanctioned Intake, and Faculty Lists.

### Module 4: Authenticity, Anomaly & Cross-Document Engine
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identifies exact file duplicates across document slots via SHA-256 hashes.
- **PDF Metadata & Incremental-Update Analysis**: Inspects PDF creation/modification dates and trailer dictionaries to detect post-issuance incremental modifications.
- **Perceptual Hashing (pHash)**: Computes image perceptual hashes using `imagehash` for computer center, chemistry lab, and library photographs to detect reused infrastructure photos across departments or institutions.
- **Real QR-Code Decoding**: Decodes embedded QR codes using `cv2.QRCodeDetector()` and executes a clearly labeled mock authority lookup verifying certificate authenticity.
- **Fuzzy Institution-Name Matching**: Uses `rapidfuzz` token-sort ratio to compare declared institutional titles against certificate titles (e.g., "Sample Institute of Tech" vs. "Sample Institute of Technology"), flagging discrepancies below 85% similarity.
- **Cross-Document Consistency**: Compares land area in Land Title deed with land area reported in Building Approval plan, flagging variances exceeding 2%.

### Module 5: Versioned YAML Compliance Rules Engine
- Declarative, human-editable YAML rulebooks (e.g., `rules_aph_2025_2026.yaml`).
- Evaluates:
  - Mandatory document completeness per category.
  - Document validity windows (e.g., Fire Safety NOC must not be expired on scrutiny baseline date).
  - Faculty-to-Student Ratio (FSR) minimum standards.
  - Minimum land area requirement based on location category.
- Records rule ID, version tag, inputs, evaluation outcome, and plain-language explanation.

### Module 6: Verification Status Matrix
Enforces six mutually exclusive, unambiguous statuses:
1. `VERIFIED`: Document or claim successfully matched and verified against authentic records/rules.
2. `MISMATCH_DETECTED`: Extracted value directly contradicts institutional records or cross-document evidence.
3. `EXPIRED`: Document validity date is prior to the scrutiny baseline date.
4. `PENDING`: Asynchronous processing, OCR pipeline, or external verification is currently in progress.
5. `SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE`: External record or third-party adapter could not be reached (distinguishing system outage from a defect).
6. `MANUAL_REVIEW_REQUIRED`: Low-confidence extraction, ambiguous wording, or infrastructure image requiring human inspection.

### Module 7: Evidence-Linked Findings & Review Triage
- Generates structured findings linking each defect directly to: Unique Finding ID, Category, Severity Priority (`CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`), Summary Description, Expected Value, Observed Value, Source Document ID, Page/Snippet Reference, Rule ID & Version, Plain-Language Explanation, and Recommended Action.
- Severity serves as an operational queue triage mechanism, explicitly avoiding unfounded claims of "fraud probability."

### Module 8: Reviewer Scrutiny Workspace & Action Management
- High-efficiency split-view dashboard: left pane renders structured findings and rule checklists; right pane previews the supporting document with the flagged field highlighted.
- Reviewer actions: `Acknowledge`, `Request Rectification`, `Override Finding` (with mandatory justification), and `Resolve Finding`.

### Module 9: Deficiency Rectification & Targeted Re-Validation Workflow
- Targeted deficiency handling:
  1. Reviewer flags a document (e.g., "Fire Safety NOC is expired").
  2. Applicant portal receives a deficiency notice specifying the exact document slot and requirement.
  3. Applicant uploads a replacement document.
  4. The platform archives the previous document version (retaining immutable audit links) and binds the replacement to the application.
  5. The IDP pipeline extracts fields from the new file.
  6. **Targeted Re-validation**: The rules engine re-runs *only* the rules dependent on that document slot.
  7. Successful validation automatically transitions the finding to `RESOLVED`; failed validation updates the finding with new evidence; untouched findings remain unaltered.

### Module 10: Hash-Chained Audit Logging & PII Masking
- **Hash-Chained Audit Store**: Each audit event records actor ID, action code, timestamp, state diff, and `previous_event_hash`, computing a cryptographic SHA-256 chain that prevents retro-active tampering.
- **PII Masking**: Automatically masks sensitive personal identifiers (Aadhaar numbers masked as `XXXX-XXXX-1234`, personal phone numbers and emails masked) in UI renders and log outputs.
- **Decision Boundary Governance**: Final regulatory approval or rejection is strictly reserved for the authorized human scrutiny officer.

## 6. Expected System Outputs

1. **Interactive Scrutiny Dashboard**: Real-time operational overview displaying triage queues, breakdown of applications by status, priority-weighted findings distribution, missing document summaries, and recent scrutiny actions.
2. **Side-by-Side Scrutiny Workspace**: Split-screen evidence viewer allowing instant inspection of extracted fields alongside original document pages with highlighted snippets.
3. **Formal Scrutiny Defect Sheet (PDF Export)**: AICTE-formatted Preliminary Scrutiny Report itemizing institutional details, category-wise checklist evaluation, identified deficiencies, citation of applicable APH clauses, and reviewer signature placeholders.
4. **Comprehensive Audit Timeline**: Chronological, hash-chained event stream displaying every automated extraction, rule check, human note, and re-validation result.
5. **Benchmark Evaluation Report**: Output from `scripts/benchmark_eval.py` reporting precision, recall, F1-score, confusion counts (TP, FP, FN, TN), and processing latency per application against ground-truth labels.
